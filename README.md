# zomato-picky
Zomato hackathon app to visually search for restaurants when you don't know what you're looking for

If you're like me, that conversation usually goes like:
- Let's go for lunch?
- Sure!
- Where are we going?
- Huh...
- What do you feel like eating?
- Huh...

However, if I look at some food photos I can pick out what I like. So the idea is to show photos until we can make an informed recommendation for a great place to eat!
